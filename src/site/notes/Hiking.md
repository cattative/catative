I found in hiking feeling of „getting with overcoming“ i m not sure i translated it in my head rightly, but still. 

Everything about it is very essential for my soul. Planning everything beforehand, responsibility for choosing right gear, maintaining self-confidence during the process, gigantism and beauty of nature.
