I just keep getting this feeling of uprising importance of other people‘s taste and thoughts inside your own info-bubble, and how much i miss that in nowadays algorithms, because it allows you to move forward, see something under other perspective.  

For me - NTS became something where i can particularly listen other people choices in music. And that‘s the whole point!

I found this App when I was thinking that I have unique Idea which I could offer to Hör. Idea was that: 1) It‘s really easy to do AI DJ with endless hours of smooth transition from track to track; 2)They should have an App where you can discover more of what you like, where DJ‘s would have possibility to share their findings weekly or monthly, and other sweets like that.
