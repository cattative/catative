I vibe coded this site, almost fully, and I don‘t see any problem about it. As long as it serves the original purpose — it‘s just useful tool in hands of creator. Imho people who say „but you‘ll forget how to code“ is the same kind of people who said that we‘ll forget how to ride a horse because of the machines. Yes, now understanding code is an important thing, but just to fix bugs which Junior-AI is making. if it will learn how to do it smooth and nice, why should you care about backbone of site or program?  

I did some lessons on freecodecamp.org before, wrote this site about kittens. But it‘s not like my passion. Maybe that is because I lost that moment in school where math can be friendly. I also did pretty simple site on neocities.org, but i felt that my views of Internet was not part of „coziness“ of the place. In total, i guess i spent about two weeks to have this level of knowledge, so i tiny bit understand some stuff but not fully, for now i m ok with what i have.
